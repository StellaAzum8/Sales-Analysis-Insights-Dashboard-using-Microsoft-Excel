## Sales Analysis Insight Dashboard with Microsoft Excel

### Project Overview
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales performance using Microsoft Excel. By leveraging a detailed dataset, key insights such as **Sales by Country**, **Top Customers**, and **Total Sales Over Time** are extracted and visualized. The dashboard allows businesses to track their sales metrics, identify top-performing regions and customers, and analyze trends over time, facilitating data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies and improve overall business performance.

### **Sales Analysis Insights**

**Spreadsheet: Original Data**  
**Description:**  
The "Original Data" sheet comprises raw sales data sourced from various sources. This data is unrefined and contained inconsistencies or inaccuracies that require resolution before proceeding with analysis.

**Data Cleaning Methods:**
- **Removing Duplicates:** Duplicate rows were identified and eliminated to ensure each sales transaction was unique.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Missing values in key columns like Product, Segment, and Sales were identified. These were either filled in where applicable or the incomplete rows were removed.
- **Standardizing Formats:** Uniformity was enforced in date formats, numerical values, and text fields. For instance, all date entries were standardized to a single format, and numerical fields such as Sales and Profit were correctly formatted.
- **Correcting Errors:** Any evident data entry mistakes were identified and corrected.
This thorough approach to data cleaning and preparation guarantees that the sales data is accurate, consistent, and ready for detailed analysis and visualization.
